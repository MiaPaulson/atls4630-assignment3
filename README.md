Above is my simple mock-up for my check list app. The following features will be present in the working app: adding a new item to the to-do list, marking items as done, deleting existing items, and clearing all checked items.

My UI components are separated as follows:
1. App (purple) - contains entire app
2. AddItem (pink) - opens up an input bar for the user to input new items for checklist
3. List (blue) - contains all items user has added to list AND a clear all checked items section
4. ListItem (red) - contains a checkbox and delete button for all items in list
